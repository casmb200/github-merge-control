# Merge controller for GitHub

This is Chrome Extensions  
We control the merging of Github by title and branch

### Example 1

![Example 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casmb200/images/master/example1.png "Example-1")

If you add a "WIP" to the title, you can not merge it into the master branch

### Example 2

![Example 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casmb200/images/master/example2.png "Example-2")

If you do not add a "Release" to the title, you can not merge it into the master branch or staging branch
